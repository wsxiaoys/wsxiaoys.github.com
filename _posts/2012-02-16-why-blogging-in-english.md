title: "Why blogging in English?"
---

I read a [blog](http://www.lixiaolai.com/archives/11513.html) by Xiaolai Li(李笑来), who is a<s>n</s> top EFL teacher in China.

Recently he start<font color="red">ed</font> blogging in English. The article in previous link is actually his first one in pure English. If you're familiar with Chinese EFL education or you've taken any classes from NewOriental(新东方) you should know that although there are many famous EFL teacher<font color="red">s</font> in China, they don't write many English articles because they focus on how to improve your GRE/TOEFL/IETLS score.

However, even I could easily find some significant grammar mistakes in Xiaolai's article<font color="red">s</font>. It's not really a big deal, like Xiaolai said:

    ... not because I am confident with my language capability, but because I just want to. I’m not a teacher when I’m writing blogs.

I really admire the bravery of exposing oneself's drawbacks. This encourages me <s>giving</s> _to give_ a serious look at myself.

For so many years, my English capability stucks at a low level. Yes it's important, but I took no actions to imporve it. For now, reading course-related English articles or papers are easy to me, but my English writing and speaking are awful. It's time to step forward.

In July, I'll attend Google and <s>became</s> _become_ a full time SWE(Software Engineer), I cannot avoid those communication<font color="red">s</font> with foreign<s>er</s> colleges. Many of them may have brilliant ideas. But if I misunderstood them and expressed myself wrongly, I'll definitely lose these opportunities. That's why I follow Xiaolai's step and start blogging in English. At least this will improve my writing to a <s>better</s> _higher_ level.

My idea is that I should keep a<s>n</s> record on anything I read that attract me and make me want to leave a comment. I'm a<s>n</s> Software Engineer and the most familiar area to me is Computer Science, writing more on this area shall be reasonble. By doing this I'll have more topics instead of losing my interests quickly because of nothing to write.

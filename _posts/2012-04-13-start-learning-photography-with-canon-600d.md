title: "Start learning photography with Canon 600D"
---

Long time no see! I bought my first [DSLR Camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera) this week and start reading the famous textbook from [New York Institute of Photography](http://www.nyip.com/).

Last night I carried my 600D, walked along the Huangpu River and took my first works.
Nightscape is hard to control and I'll take a tripod decidely next time :).

My starting point, not very stable

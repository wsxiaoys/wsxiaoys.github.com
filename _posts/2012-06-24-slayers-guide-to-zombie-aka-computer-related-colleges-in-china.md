This article is still in *Draft*

    Disclaimer:

    The article below is the review of my 4-years studying in the Software Engineering College of Tongji University. It contains my complaints and satires which may lead to discomfort.
    
    Anyway it may not match the experiences of others, so be wise when reading it.
    
    The title "Slayer's guide to Zombie" comes from the book series of D&D rules(aka 轰杀指南系列).

On 13th June I received the degree of Bachelor from the college, an impressive ceremony was held and my tassel was moved to the left side. Everything I experienced looks great and people asked me about them. Well what could I tell, I'm not you. All choices you made depend on what you are and what your believe.

I would say the College is not really a good place to study, but it may fit you well. Since many people believe that the courses are great and the professors are "professional", I think my views here could be helpful.

In short, my conclusion is that College may be a good place to make you hot in the job market, but it's totally a disaster to the ambitious ones. As if the endless zombies flush into your garden aiming at destroying your flowers of dreams. Whatever, if you're still interested, read on and find out why I think so.

## Non-professional Professors
Yes I know there are distinguished professors in THU and PKU. But unfortunately, as a university of 985 and 211, TJU doesn't have one. 

True we have a dean owns the title of Academician, the highest honor in China. But I have never seen him in the campus (Not to mention his hollow [research fields](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%91%A8%E5%85%B4%E9%93%AD)).

It is common sense in China that a College hire such a person to build its reputation. But for us students this is totally meaningless.

For some young professors, though some of them may have a eager to teach the student or develop more in academic works, they could never dedicate to them. Stupid Professor Evaluation System in China stops them from doing stuff that make sense and force them writing more and more nonsense papers to meet the requirement.

Let me tell you a fun story about our professors. If you know me, you should know Compilers and Programming Languages attracted me the most. In no doubt I'll raise my hand when Professor's words is ambiguous in the Compiler Principle class.

Do you know what happened? He simply ignored the questions and start checking my attendance records (I presented *EVERY TIME*). That's what you get because of your thirst for knowledge from a Professor.

It's not the end, just after I gave up and sat down. A girl (while she is pretty I think) stood up and asked the same question. Miracle happened, he explained that with his best effort and showed us a detailed example. 

OK, this might just be a single case, but for most courses, if you were a pretty girl or you left strong impression to the Professor, your grade will goes up quite a lot, no matter how strong you're in those courses.

For me, quite few knowledge are acquired from them. The only good thing is that some of them give me the maximum freedom in their courses to develop my personal interesting. But if you want to ask them a problem? Oh dear, you'd better Google it first.
